This application is built with Python and employs Tkinter and SQLite3 for an intuitive player management system. You can easily download or clone the files, and run the `main.py` in your terminal after installing Python. The GUI allows you to register players, explore player details, and construct lineups! 

Tkinter and sqlite3, are both standard Python 3 packages as well so this setup is completely hassle-free ðŸ™‚
